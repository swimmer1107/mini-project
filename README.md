# 🌾 AI-Driven Smart Agriculture & Crop Intelligence System

## 📌 Project Description

The AI-Driven Smart Agriculture & Crop Intelligence System is a web-based application designed to help farmers make better crop decisions using Machine Learning and real-time weather data.

The system takes environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil type, and pH value as input and predicts the most suitable crop to grow. It also provides weather information, prediction history, and user authentication for a personalized experience.

This project aims to improve agricultural productivity by providing intelligent recommendations based on data analysis.
